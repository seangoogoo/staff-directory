# FastRoute Implementation Technical Overview

## Core Architecture

FastRoute will be implemented as a central request dispatcher, handling all incoming HTTP requests through a single entry point (`index.php`). This replaces our current direct file access approach with a robust routing system.

## Configuration Structure

### Path Configuration
All core paths are centralized in `config/app.php`, including:
- Base application paths
- Private file locations
- Public directories
- URL base paths
- Route cache locations

### Route Definition
Routes are defined in `config/router.php`, which:
- Initializes the FastRoute dispatcher
- Contains all route definitions
- Maps URLs to controller actions
- Handles dispatch results

## Request Flow

1. **Entry Point**
   - All requests hit `staff-directory/index.php`
   - Apache's mod_rewrite (via .htaccess) handles URL rewriting
   - Bootstrap loads environment and configurations

2. **Route Dispatch**
   - FastRoute parses the incoming URL
   - Matches against defined routes
   - Extracts URL parameters (if any)
   - Determines the appropriate handler

3. **Handler Execution**
   - Routes map to controller methods
   - Controllers receive parsed request data
   - Authentication/authorization checks occur
   - Response is generated and returned

## Key Benefits

- **Centralized Control**: All routing logic in one location
- **Clean Separation**: URL structure decoupled from file structure
- **Enhanced Security**: No direct file access
- **Maintainability**: Routes are explicitly defined and documented
- **Performance**: Optional route caching for production
- **Flexibility**: Easy to add/modify routes without touching files

## Error Handling

- 404 (Not Found) handling for undefined routes
- 405 (Method Not Allowed) for incorrect HTTP methods
- Centralized error handling through dedicated error controllers

## Authentication Integration

- Route middleware can enforce authentication
- Admin routes can be grouped with common auth checks
- Session validation occurs before route handling

## Route Fallback Behavior

### Default Route Handling
- All undefined routes will fall back to the main index page
- This maintains backward compatibility with the current system
- Implementation uses a catch-all route pattern

### Implementation Strategy
1. Define explicit routes first (admin routes, API endpoints, etc.)
2. Add a catch-all route that matches any undefined path
3. The catch-all route redirects to the main index controller
4. Preserves current user experience where all unknown paths show the staff directory

### Exception Cases
- Admin paths still require authentication
- API endpoints still return proper 404 responses
- Static file requests (assets, uploads) bypass the router

This approach ensures that:
- Specific functionality (admin, API) works as expected
- All other requests display the main staff directory
- The application maintains its current user-friendly behavior

This implementation provides a robust foundation for future application growth while maintaining security and maintainability.
